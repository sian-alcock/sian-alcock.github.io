            <p>In December 2000, I co-founded a software business. We delivered award-winning risk management software to Fortune 500 companies, world-wide. Whilst travelling for a year after shrinking the business in 2018, I spent time thinking about what I really wanted to do next career-wise.</p>
            <p>After learning about coding bootcamps, I decided that undertaking the General Assembly Software Engineering course would give me the tools I needed to support a career change into a role that would challenge me intellectually.</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed the course and I was astonished at how much I could learn in such a short time. I discovered that after learning one programming language / framework, that mastering the next was much easier because even though syntax might vary, the underlying mechanics are broadly the same.</p>
            <p>I am excited now to pursue a role of Junior Software Engineer in a company that will help me to consolidate everything I have learned and to start to build real-world, fully functional applications from end-to-end.</p>
